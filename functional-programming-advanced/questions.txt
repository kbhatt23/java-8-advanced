a. Why variables used inside lambda are made final/effectively final
		-> Meaning variables can not be modified inside , beofre or after the lambda code 
	-> This is done so that a mehtod declared within one method cna be packed into a closure and that lambda can be passed to another higher order function and be executed there
		-> a lambda body whihc is using a local method variable cna still be executed in another method
		-> f variable was not final , there could be inconsitency in logic of lambda as variable got changed outside lambda before or after its execution
		
b. Why do we need chain creation method o use method Objects.requiresNull(chainingFunctionlaInterfaceInstance);		

c. Why does map.values() method return collection and not list or set
d. Write a program to support pagination of list of T , pass sizeperPage and pagenumber (0 based index)
e. Why do we need int charachterstics in custom spliterator like arraylists's plitareator:
	-> for eg: if we are using sortedset whihc have charachter bit set for sorted item
	-> ad if we are using stream pipeline on sortedset and using operation sorted()
		-> it will already know the intermeiate spliterator have charachterstics of sorted bit and hence no need to sort again , just go to next operation in strema pipeline
		-> similarly for hashset if we use intermediate opeation distinct() it wont remove duplicates 
			as hashet is already distinct and henc ebypass this operation and go for next operation
